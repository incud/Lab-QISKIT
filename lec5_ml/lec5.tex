\begin{frame}{Aspects of QC that can improve ML}

Several algorithms for quantum computers have been proposed which improve the performance of machine learning software. Here we consider some \emph{classification} problem. We assume that \(N\) is the size of the training set and \(M\) the number of features per sample. \bigskip

Samples $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are encoded through a piece of circuit called \emph{feature map} $U(x)$.

    Algorithm & Improvement \\ \midrule
    SWAP-test & Distance procedure from \(O(M)\) to \(O(\log(M))\)  \\[1em]
    QSVM & The quantum circuit act ``like" a kernel function  \\[1em]
    QNN & Sometimes lead to faster training  \\[1em]
