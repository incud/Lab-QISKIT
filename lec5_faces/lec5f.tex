%\begin{frame}{The problem}
%Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an extremely relevant task associated with human-computer interaction, with applications in predictive environments, content analysis, support for healthcare, and many more. 

%\bigskip FER is a classification problem, in which each picture representing a face have to be associated with its expression.

%\bigskip It is possible to solve FER with supervised learning approaches starting from a dataset for labelled pictures.
%\end{frame}



%\begin{frame}{The problem (2)}
%FER is solved using a quantum circuit that encodes:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item a subset of the dataset;
%    \item the unlabelled test instance
%\end{itemize} 
%into quantum states.

%\bigskip Then, infer the test label as the one of the closest item in terms of Euclidian distance.
